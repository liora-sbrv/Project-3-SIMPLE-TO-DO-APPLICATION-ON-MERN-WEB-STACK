# In this task, I was tasked to implement a web solution based on MERN stack in AWS Cloud.
MERN Web stack consists of following components:

MongoDB: A document-based, No-SQL database used to store application data in a form of documents.

ExpressJS: A server side Web Application framework for Node.js.

ReactJS: A frontend framework developed by Facebook. It is based on JavaScript, used to build User Interface (UI) components.

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment. It is used to run JavaScript on a machine rather than in a browser.

A user interacts with the ReactJS UI components at the application front-end residing in the browser. This frontend is served by the application backend residing in a server, through ExpressJS running on top of NodeJS.

Any interaction that causes a data change request is sent to the NodeJS based Express server, which grabs data from the MongoDB database if required, and returns the data to the frontend of the application, which is then presented to the user.

Side Self Study

I will make a research what types of Database Management Systems (DBMS) exist and what each type is more suitable for. I will to be able to explain the difference between Relational DBMS and NoSQL (of a different kind).
I will get myself familiar with a concept of Web Application Frameworks. I will get to know what server-side (backend) and client-side (forntend) frameworks exist and what they are used for.
I will practice basic JavaScript syntax just for fun.
I will Explore what RESTful API is and what it is used for in Web development.
I will read what Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used for and browse basic syntax and properties.

# Step 0 â€“ Preparing prerequisites
 
 In order to complete this project I will need an AWS account and a virtual server with Ubuntu Server OS.
